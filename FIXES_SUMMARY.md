## 🔧 ISSUE #1: PARENT PORTAL INCOMPLETE

### Problem
Parent portal endpoints were returning 501 (Not Implemented):
- GET `/api/parents/:id/children/:studentId/grades` → 501
- GET `/api/parents/:id/children/:studentId/schedule` → 501
- GET `/api/parents/:id/children/:studentId/health-records` → 501
- GET `/api/parents/:id/statistics` → 501
- PUT `/api/parents/:id/students/:relationId` → 501
- DELETE `/api/parents/:id/students/:relationId` → 501

### Solution Implemented
✅ **File:** `backend/src/controllers/parentController.js`

**6 New Methods:**

1. **getChildGrades()**
   - Retrieves child's grades with exam details
   - Verifies parent-student relationship
   - Includes subject and teacher information
   - Multi-tenant isolated

2. **getChildSchedule()**
   - Gets child's class schedule
   - Shows day, subject, teacher, time
   - Filters by tenant and relationship

3. **getChildHealthRecords()**
   - Retrieves child's health records
   - Shows medical history
   - Includes record types and dates

4. **getParentStatistics()**
   - Shows total children count
   - Lists all children with grades
   - Provides education level info

5. **updateParentRelation()**
   - Updates parent-student relationship
   - Validates relationship exists
   - Maintains audit trail

6. **deleteParentRelation()**
   - Removes parent-student relationship
   - Proper authorization checks
   - Cascading delete handling

### Result
✅ All parent portal endpoints now functional  
✅ Proper relationship verification  
✅ Multi-tenant isolation maintained  
✅ Comprehensive error handling
