# Blueprint: Multi-Tenant SaaS Application

## Overview

This document outlines the plan and progress for building a multi-tenant SaaS application. The application will allow different tenants (organizations) to sign up and manage their own users, data, and resources in an isolated manner.

## Application Features & Design

### Implemented Features

*   **Database Setup:** The project is configured to use SQLite for local development and PostgreSQL for production.
*   **Tenant Model:** A `Tenant` model has been created with the following fields:
    *   `id`: Unique identifier for the tenant.
    *   `name`: The name of the tenant's organization.
    *   `email`: The primary contact email for the tenant.

### Current Plan: Tenant Management UI

The immediate goal is to build the user interface for creating and viewing tenants.

#### Steps:

1.  **Create Tenant Page:**
    *   A new page will be created at the `/tenants` route.
    *   This page will be a Server Component to allow for direct data fetching from the database.

2.  **Tenant Creation Form:**
    *   The page will feature a form with the following fields:
        *   `Name`: A text input for the tenant's organization name.
        *   `Email`: An email input for the tenant's contact email.
    *   A "Create Tenant" button will submit the form.

3.  **Server Action for Tenant Creation:**
    *   A Server Action will be created to handle the form submission.
    *   This action will:
        *   Receive the form data.
        *   Use Prisma Client to create a new `Tenant` record in the database.
        *   Revalidate the `/tenants` page to reflect the new data immediately without a manual refresh.

4.  **Display Tenant List:**
    *   Below the form, the page will fetch and display a list of all existing tenants.
    *   The list will show the `name` and `email` for each tenant.

5.  **Styling and Design:**
    *   The page will be styled using modern design principles to ensure a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience.
    *   This includes:
        *   **Typography:** Clear and readable fonts with a strong visual hierarchy.
        *   **Color Palette:** A professional and aesthetically pleasing color scheme.
        *   **Layout:** A well-structured layout with ample spacing for clarity.
        *   **Components:** Styled form inputs and buttons that provide good user feedback.
