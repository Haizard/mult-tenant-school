# Brainstorming: Multi-Tenant School Management System

## ðŸš¨ **IMPORTANT: Architecture Update**
**This document has been updated with a new multi-tenant architecture. Please read the [ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE.md](./ARCHITECTURE_UPDATE.md) document first for the latest implementation details.**

### **Key Changes:**

- âœ… **Role-Based Dashboards**: Each role has completely different interfaces
- âœ… **Tenant Creation Flow**: Super Admin creates schools with admin users
- âœ… **School User Management**: Tenant Admin creates teachers, students, staff
- âœ… **NECTA Compliance**: Tanzanian education standards implementation
- âœ… **Comprehensive Audit Logging**: All actions tracked and logged
- âœ… **Multi-Tenant Isolation**: Proper data separation between schools

3. Implementation of User & Role Management with multi-tenancy.


# Brainstorming: User & Role Management Module

## Purpose
To define the functionalities and considerations for the User & Role Management module within the multi-tenant school management system, ensuring data isolation and proper access control for different user types and tenants.

## Core Features

### 1. User Registration & Authentication
- **Tenant-specific registration:** Users register under a specific school/tenant.
- **Multiple authentication methods:** Email/password, social logins (optional), SSO (optional).
- **Password policies:** Strength requirements, expiry, reset mechanisms.
- **Account activation:** Email verification.

### 2. User Profiles
- **Basic information:** Name, contact details, address.
- **Tenant association:** Clearly link users to their respective schools.
- **Role assignment:** Assign one or more roles to a user.
- **Status management:** Active/inactive, suspended.

### 3. Role Management
- **Predefined roles:** Super Admin (system-wide), School Admin, Teacher, Student, Parent, Staff.
- **Custom roles (optional):** Ability for School Admins to define custom roles with specific permissions.
- **Role hierarchy/inheritance:** Define relationships between roles (e.g., School Admin inherits some Super Admin permissions within their tenant).

### 4. Permissions & Access Control
- **Granular permissions:** Define specific actions users can perform (e.g., create student, edit teacher profile, view grades).
- **Role-based access control (RBAC):** Permissions tied to roles.
- **Tenant-based access control:** Ensure users can only access data within their assigned tenant.
- **Attribute-based access control (ABAC) (optional):** More dynamic access based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environmental conditions.

### 5. Multi-Tenancy Considerations
- **Data Isolation:** Crucial to ensure users from one school cannot access data from another.
  - Implement `tenant_id` or `school_id` as a discriminator column in all relevant tables.
  - Enforce application-level filtering on all data access queries.
- **User ID uniqueness:** User IDs should be unique across the entire system, not just within a tenant.
- **Super Admin role:** A system-level role that can manage all tenants and system configurations.

### 6. Audit Trails & Logging

- **Database:** Relational database (PostgreSQL) with strong support for indexing and efficient querying with discriminator columns.
- **Authentication Library/Service:** Passport.js, Auth0 etc.

## Next Steps
- Detail specific API endpoints for user and role management.

- **Performance Evaluation (Future Consideration):** Tools for evaluating teacher performance and professional development.
- **Teacher Status Management:** Active, inactive, on leave.

## Multi-Tenancy Considerations
- **Data Isolation:** All student and teacher data must be strictly isolated by `tenant_id` or `school_id`.
  - Ensure all queries for student and teacher information include the `tenant_id` filter.
- **Unique Identifiers:** While `tenant_id` ensures isolation, consider a global unique identifier for students/teachers if cross-tenant analytics or transfers are ever envisioned (future consideration).
- **Role-Based Access:** School administrators can only manage students and teachers within their own tenant. Super admins can view across all tenants.

## Relationships
- **Users:** Students and Teachers are also users of the system, linked to the User & Role Management module for authentication and authorization.
- **Classes/Subjects:** Direct relationships with the Academic Management module for class and subject assignments.
- **Attendance:** Direct relationship with the Attendance Management module.

## Reporting
- Generate reports on student demographics, enrollment trends, teacher workload, etc.

## Technology Stack Considerations
- **Backend:** Robust ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) to handle complex relationships and ensure `tenant_id` filtering on all relevant models.
- **Frontend:** User-friendly interfaces for data entry, search, and filtering of student and teacher records.

## Next Steps
- Design detailed database schemas for student and teacher profiles, including all relevant fields and relationships.
- Define API endpoints for CRUD operations on student and teacher data.
- Plan UI/UX for student and teacher management screens, including search, filter, and bulk action capabilities.


# Brainstorming: Academic Management Module

## Tanzania Specific Academic Rules & Calculations

### 1. Subject Management Across Levels (Primary, O-Level, A-Level)
- **Challenge:** Handling subjects with the same name (e.g., History) but different curricula/depth across Primary, O-Level, and A-Level.
- **Solution:** Implement a `subject_level` attribute (e.g., 'Primary', 'O-Level', 'A-Level') in the subject definition. This allows for unique identification and curriculum mapping for subjects with similar names but different academic contexts.
- **System Impact:** Subject assignment to students and teachers must consider both the subject name and its associated level.

### 2. O-Level Subject Categorization & Division Calculation
- **Context:** O-Level students have 'recommended' (core) and 'choice' subjects. Only core subjects are used for division calculation.
- **Solution:**
  - **Subject Type Attribute:** Add a `subject_type` attribute (e.g., 'Core', 'Optional', 'Combination') to each subject. For O-Level, this would be 'Core' or 'Optional'.
  - **Enrollment Rules:** Configure rules to enforce the number of 'choice' subjects a student can take (e.g., limited to three as per NACTE guidelines).
  - **Division Calculation Logic:** When calculating divisions, the system will filter subjects based on their `subject_type` (e.g., only 'Core' subjects for O-Level) and apply the relevant NECTA grading criteria.

### 3. A-Level Subject Categorization & Division Calculation
- **Context:** A-Level students have 'combination' subjects (e.g., EGM, PCB, HKL) and additional 'recommended' subjects. Only combination subjects are used for division calculation.
- **Solution:**
  - **Combination Subject Grouping:** Define 'combination' subjects as a distinct group or type. This could involve linking individual subjects (e.g., Physics, Chemistry, Biology for PCB) to a 'combination' identifier.
  - **Enrollment Rules:** Enforce rules for A-Level combinations and any mandatory 'recommended' subjects that must be taken alongside them.
  - **Division Calculation Logic:** Similar to O-Level, the system will identify and use only the 'combination' subjects for division calculation, applying the specific NECTA A-Level grading criteria.

### 4. Flexible Calculation Engine
- **Requirement:** The system needs to be flexible enough to accommodate different calculation methodologies (grades, GPA, division) and adapt to potential future changes (e.g., Tanzania moving to a full GPA system).
- **Solution:** Design a configurable calculation engine that allows administrators to define:
  - Which subjects are included in specific calculations (based on `subject_type`, `subject_level`, etc.).
  - The weighting of different subjects or subject types.
  - The formulas for converting raw marks to grades, GPA, or divisions.
  - The criteria for assigning divisions (e.g., sum of points, average grade).

### 5. Data Structure Implications
- **Subjects Table:** Needs `subject_level` and `subject_type` columns.
- **Enrollment Table:** Needs to link students to subjects and their specific levels/types.
- **Grading/Results Table:** Needs to store marks for each subject, and potentially calculated intermediate values (e.g., points for division calculation).
- **Configuration Tables:** For defining calculation rules, subject combinations, and enrollment constraints.

### 6. NECTA Grading System (Summary from Research)
- NECTA is the primary body for national examinations and grading in Tanzania.
- Divisions are currently in use, with a potential future shift towards a GPA system.
- The system must be able to interpret and apply NECTA's specific grading criteria for both O-Level and A-Level to accurately calculate divisions.
