# Project Brief: Multi-Tenant School Management System

## Introduction

This project outlines the development of a comprehensive, multi-tenant School Management System designed to streamline administrative, academic, and operational processes for educational institutions. The system aims to provide a robust, scalable, and secure platform that caters to the diverse needs of schools, offering a centralized solution for managing students, teachers, courses, examinations, and more. The vision is to create an intuitive and efficient ecosystem that enhances communication, automates routine tasks, and provides valuable insights through data analytics.

### Core Vision

To empower educational institutions with a unified digital platform that simplifies management, fosters collaboration, and improves overall efficiency, while ensuring data security and scalability through a multi-tenant architecture.

### Key Features Overview

The system will encompass a wide range of functionalities, including but not limited to:

*   **User & Role Management:** Secure and flexible management of various user types (e.g., students, teachers, administrators) with role-based access control, ensuring data segregation and appropriate permissions within the multi-tenant framework.
*   **Academic Management:** Comprehensive modules for managing courses, classes, subjects, timetables, and academic calendars, tailored to support diverse educational structures, including specific handling for different academic levels (Primary, O-Level, A-Level, University).
    *   **Classes & Subjects Across Levels:**
        *   **Challenge:** Handling subjects with the same name (e.g., History) but different curricula/depth across Primary, O-Level, A-Level, and University levels.
        *   **Solution:** Implement a `subject_level` attribute (e.g., 'Primary', 'O-Level', 'A-Level', 'University') in the subject definition. This allows for unique identification and curriculum mapping for subjects with similar names but different academic contexts.
        *   **System Impact:** Subject assignment to students and teachers must consider both the subject name and its associated level.
    *   **Student Enrollment & Assignment:**
        *   **Enrollment & Registration:** Streamlined process for new student enrollment, including assigning to academic years, classes, and sections, ensuring students are registered under the correct school (tenant-specific).
        *   **Class & Section Assignment:** Flexible assignment of students to classes and sections, with options for bulk updates.
        *   **Teacher-Student Assignment:** Teachers can be assigned to specific classes, sections, and subjects, with assignments being tenant-specific.
    *   **O-Level Specifics:**
        *   **Context:** O-Level students have 'recommended' (core) and 'choice' subjects. Only core subjects are used for division calculation.
        *   **Enrollment Rules:** Configure rules to enforce the number of 'choice' subjects a student can take (e.g., limited to three as per NACTE guidelines).
        *   **Division Calculation Logic:** When calculating divisions, the system will filter subjects based on their `subject_type` (e.g., only 'Core' subjects for O-Level) and apply the relevant NECTA grading criteria.
    *   **A-Level Specifics:**
        *   **Context:** A-Level students have 'combination' subjects (e.g., EGM, PCB, HKL) and additional 'recommended' subjects. Only combination subjects are used for division calculation.
        *   **Combination Subject Grouping:** Define 'combination' subjects as a distinct group or type. This could involve linking individual subjects (e.g., Physics, Chemistry, Biology for PCB) to a 'combination' identifier.
        *   **Enrollment Rules:** Enforce rules for A-Level combinations and any mandatory 'recommended' subjects that must be taken alongside them.
        *   **Division Calculation Logic:** Similar to O-Level, the system will identify and use only the 'combination' subjects for division calculation, applying the specific NECTA A-Level grading criteria.
    *   **Subject Weighting & Inclusion:**
        *   The system will allow configuration of which subjects are included in specific calculations (based on `subject_type`, `subject_level`, etc.).
        *   The weighting of different subjects or subject types can also be configured.
    *   **Database Schema Considerations:**
        *   The `Subjects Table` will need `subject_level` and `subject_type` columns.
        *   The `Enrollment Table` will need to link students to subjects and their specific levels/types.
*   **Student & Teacher Management:** Centralized profiles for students and teachers, including personal details, academic records, attendance, performance, and communication logs.
*   **Examination & Grading:** Tools for creating, scheduling, and managing examinations, recording grades, and generating report cards, with support for various grading systems.
*   **Attendance Management:** Efficient tracking of student and teacher attendance, with reporting capabilities and integration with other modules.
*   **Communication & Notifications:** Integrated messaging, announcement, and notification systems to facilitate seamless communication among all stakeholders.
*   **Reporting & Analytics:** Customizable reports and dashboards to provide insights into academic performance, attendance trends, financial data, and operational efficiency.
*   **Multi-Tenancy Architecture:** Designed from the ground up to support multiple independent school instances on a single deployment, ensuring data isolation and customizable configurations for each tenant.
*   **Cross-Cutting Features:** Robust security measures, audit trails, data import/export capabilities, theming, and customization options to enhance usability and compliance.
*   **Future AI Integration:** Planned incorporation of AI-powered features for personalized learning paths, predictive analytics, and intelligent automation to further enhance the educational experience.

### Initial Technology Stack

The system will be built using a modern and scalable technology stack, including:

*   **Backend:** Node.js (with Express.js or similar framework) for high performance and scalability.
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL for robust and reliable data storage, supporting complex queries and large datasets.
*   **Frontend:** React.js for a dynamic, responsive, and user-friendly web interface.
*   **Containerization & Orchestration:** Docker for containerization and Kubernetes for orchestration, ensuring easy deployment, scalability, and high availability.

This project brief will delve deeper into each of these areas, providing a detailed roadmap for the development and implementation of the School Management System.
