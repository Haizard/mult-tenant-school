## 4. Technical Assumptions

### 4.1. Repository Structure: Polyrepo (Frontend, Backend, and potentially separate services)

### 4.2. Service Architecture
- **Microservices/Modular Architecture:** The system will be designed with a modular approach, potentially using microservices for distinct functionalities (e.g., User Management, Academic Management, Finance).
- **API-First Approach:** All functionalities will be exposed via well-defined APIs to support various client applications.
- **Multi-Tenancy:** Implemented using a shared database with a discriminator column (`tenant_id` or `school_id`) for strict data isolation at the application level.

### 4.3. Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:** Comprehensive unit tests for all critical components and business logic.
- **Integration Tests:** Tests to ensure seamless interaction between different modules and services.
- **End-to-End Tests:** Automated tests simulating user journeys to validate overall system functionality.
- **Performance Tests:** To ensure scalability and responsiveness under expected load.
- **Security Tests:** Regular security audits and penetration testing.

### 4.4. Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
- **Cloud-Native Deployment:** The system will be designed for deployment on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP) leveraging managed services where appropriate.
- **Scalability:** The architecture should support horizontal scaling to accommodate a growing number of tenants and users.
- **Data Security & Privacy:** Adherence to best practices for data encryption (at rest and in transit), access control, and compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- **Technology Stack:** (To be determined by the technical team, but assumed to be modern and widely supported frameworks/languages for both frontend and backend).
