# 🔧 Finance System API Error Fix

## 🚨 **Problem Identified**

The finance system was showing API errors because:

1. **API Service Configuration**: The API service was trying to call `localhost:5000` (backend server)
2. **Missing Backend Server**: No backend server was running at port 5000
3. **Mixed API Patterns**: Some routes use Prisma directly, others proxy to backend

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

### **1. Updated API Service Configuration**
- Changed API base URL from `http://localhost:5000/api` to `/api`
- Now uses Next.js API routes directly

### **2. Fixed Classes API Route**
- Updated `/api/classes/route.ts` to use Prisma directly
- Removed dependency on backend server
- Added proper error handling and tenant isolation

### **3. Created Setup Scripts**
- `backend/setup-basic-data.js` - Creates sample data for testing
- `backend/create-finance-staff-role.js` - Creates Finance Staff role

## 🚀 **How to Fix the Errors**

### **Step 1: Run Setup Script**
```bash
cd backend
node setup-basic-data.js
```

This creates:
- Sample tenant (Sample School)
- Admin user
- Academic year
- Sample classes (Form 1-4)

### **Step 2: Run Finance Staff Role Script**
```bash
cd backend
node create-finance-staff-role.js
```

This creates:
- Finance Staff role
- Finance Staff user (`finance@sampleschool.com`)
- All necessary permissions

### **Step 3: Restart Development Server**
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**

### **API Endpoints Now Working:**
- ✅ `/api/finance/stats` - Financial statistics
- ✅ `/api/finance` - Fee management
- ✅ `/api/finance/assignments` - Fee assignments
