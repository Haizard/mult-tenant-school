# User Story: As a Tenant Admin, I want to create and manage courses and subjects with support for different academic levels (Primary, O-Level, A-Level) and subject types (Core, Optional, Combination), so that I can organize the academic structure of my school according to Tanzanian education standards.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to create courses with course codes, descriptions, and credits.
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to create subjects with support for different academic levels (Primary, O-Level, A-Level, University).
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to define subject types (Core, Optional, Combination) for NECTA compliance.
- The system shall ensure that subjects with the same name but different academic levels are uniquely identified.
- The system shall prevent unauthorized access to academic data based on tenant isolation.
- The system shall support the assignment of teachers to specific subjects within their tenant.
- **The system shall enforce role-based access control for academic management functions.**
- **Students shall have read-only access to their assigned courses and subjects only.**
- **Teachers shall have read-only access to courses and subjects, with write access to gradebooks and assessments.**
- **Tenant Admins shall have full CRUD access to courses, subjects, and teacher assignments.**
- **Super Admins shall have system-wide view access to academic data across all tenants.**
