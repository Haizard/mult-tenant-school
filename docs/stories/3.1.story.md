# User Story: As a Teacher, I want to track student attendance for my classes. As a Tenant Admin, I want to monitor overall attendance and generate reports.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow a Teacher to take daily/session-based attendance for their classes, marking students as Present, Absent, Late, or Excused.
- The system shall provide an interface for Tenant Admins to view attendance data for the entire school and filter by class, date, or status.
- The system shall automatically send notifications to parents/guardians when a student is marked as absent without a valid reason.
- The system shall allow Tenant Admins to define and customize attendance policies (e.g., grace periods for lateness).
- The system shall generate attendance reports (daily, weekly, monthly) for individual students, classes, or the entire school.
- The system shall ensure that all attendance data is isolated by tenant.

## Examples:
- **Daily Attendance Example:** A teacher opens their dashboard, selects the current class, and is presented with a list of students. They can quickly tap to mark each student's attendance status. The system defaults to 'Present' to speed up the process.
- **Automated Notification Example:** A student is marked 'Absent'. If the school has a policy for immediate notification, the system automatically sends an SMS to the student's registered parent/guardian: "Dear Parent, your child, [Student Name], has been marked absent from school today, [Date]. Please contact the school office if you have any questions."

## Potential Obstacles:
- **Real-time Performance:** In a large school, hundreds of teachers might be taking attendance simultaneously. The system must be able to handle these concurrent requests without a significant drop in performance.
- **Integration with Multiple Capture Methods:** While the initial version may focus on manual entry, future integration with biometric scanners, RFID readers, or mobile app check-ins will require a flexible and extensible architecture.
- **Complex Attendance Policies:** Different schools may have very different and complex rules for what constitutes 'Late' vs. 'Absent', or how many 'Excused' absences are allowed per term. The system needs a flexible rule engine to accommodate this.

## Dev Notes:

### Previous Story Insights:
- User & Role Management (Story 1.1) is essential to ensure only authorized teachers can mark attendance and only relevant people can view the data.
- Class Scheduling & Timetable Management (Story 2.2) provides the class context for which attendance is being taken.

### Data Models:
- **AttendanceRecords Table:** To store daily attendance records for each student in each class session.
- **AttendancePolicies Table:** To store tenant-specific attendance rules and notification settings.

## Tasks / Subtasks:
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1): Implement the interface for teachers to take attendance.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2): Implement the dashboard for Tenant Admins to view and filter attendance data.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3): Set up the automated notification system for absent students.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 4): Implement the interface for Tenant Admins to configure attendance policies.
- [ ] Task 5 (AC: 5): Develop the functionality to generate various attendance reports.
- [ ] Task 6 (AC: 6): Ensure strict tenant isolation for all attendance data and policies.
- [ ] Task 7 (Future): Design the architecture to support multiple attendance capture methods.
