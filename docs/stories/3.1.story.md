# User Story: As a Teacher, I want to mark and track student attendance daily, so that I can monitor student presence and identify attendance patterns.

## ðŸš¨ **ARCHITECTURE UPDATE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

### **âœ… ARCHITECTURE CONTEXT:**
- **Multi-Tenant Hierarchy**: Teachers mark attendance for their classes within their school
- **Data Isolation**: Attendance data must be tenant-isolated
- **Role-Based Access**: Teachers can mark attendance for their classes
- **Parent Access**: Parents can view their children's attendance
- **Audit Logging**: All attendance actions logged

### **âœ… IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:**
- Use `attendance` table with `tenant_id` filtering
- Implement role-based attendance access
- Use `auditLogger.ts` for attendance marking actions
- Follow NECTA compliance for attendance policies
- Implement automated notifications for parents

### **âœ… REQUIRED COMPONENTS:**
- **Attendance Dashboard** - Teacher interface for marking attendance
- **Attendance Tracking** - Daily attendance recording system
- **Parent Notifications** - Automated absence notifications
- **Attendance Reports** - Attendance analytics and reports
- **Leave Management** - Student leave request system

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow teachers to mark daily attendance for their assigned classes.
- The system shall support multiple attendance statuses (Present, Absent, Late, Excused).
- The system shall provide real-time attendance updates to relevant stakeholders.
- The system shall send automated notifications to parents for unexplained absences.
- The system shall generate attendance reports and analytics for individual students and classes.
- The system shall support leave request management and approval workflows.
- The system shall ensure attendance data is isolated within the tenant.
- The system shall integrate with academic records for attendance-based interventions.
