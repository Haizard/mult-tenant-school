# User Story: As a Tenant Admin, I want to create and manage classes and sections within my school, so that I can organize students and teachers effectively for academic delivery.

## ðŸš¨ **ARCHITECTURE UPDATE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION**

- **Audit Logging**: All class management actions logged

### **âœ… IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:**
- Use `classes` table with `tenant_id` filtering
- Implement class-teacher-student relationships within tenant
- Use `academicFilters.ts` for class data access
- Follow NECTA compliance for class structure
- Implement proper class scheduling within tenant

### **âœ… REQUIRED COMPONENTS:**
- **Class Management Dashboard** - Tenant Admin interface for class management
- **Class Creation System** - Class and section creation
