# User Story: As a Tenant Admin, I want to create and manage user accounts for students, teachers, and staff within my school, so that I can control access to the system and maintain accurate records.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to create new user accounts with specified roles (Student, Teacher, Staff).
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to edit existing user profiles and assign/reassign roles.
- The system shall ensure that each user account has a unique identifier within the tenant.
- The system shall prevent unauthorized access to tenant-specific data based on assigned roles.
- **The system shall provide dedicated dashboard panels for each user role with role-specific functionality and restrictions.**
- **Students shall only access student-specific features and cannot manage users, create courses, or access administrative functions.**
- **Teachers shall access teacher-specific features including academic management but cannot manage users or access tenant administration.**
- **Tenant Admins shall have full access to user management, role assignment, and tenant-specific administrative functions.**
- **Super Admins shall have system-wide access across all tenants with global administrative capabilities.**

## Dev Notes:

### Previous Story Insights:
No previous story insights available.

### Data Models:
-   **Users Table:** Authentication and authorization details (linked to Students/Teachers/Admins) will be managed in a `Users` table within PostgreSQL. Data will be normalized, relationships established with foreign keys, and appropriate indexing applied.

### API Specifications:
-   **RESTful APIs:** Primary method for external systems and frontend applications to interact with the backend services. All API endpoints will be secured using industry-standard authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) and authorization (e.g., RBAC) mechanisms.

### Component Specifications:
-   **Frontend:** React components will be developed for user account creation, editing, and role management.
-   **Backend:** Node.js services will handle user account logic, interacting with the PostgreSQL database.

### File Locations:
-   Frontend components will reside in the `frontend/src/components` directory (or similar, based on project structure).
-   Backend API routes and controllers will be in `backend/routes` and `backend/controllers` respectively.
-   Database models/schemas will be defined in `backend/models`.

### Testing Requirements:
-   Unit tests for backend API endpoints (e.g., user creation, update, role assignment).
-   Integration tests to ensure proper interaction between frontend and backend.
-   End-to-end tests for user account management flows.
-   Security tests for authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Technical Constraints:
-   **Frontend:** React
-   **Backend:** Node.js
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Authentication:** OAuth2/JWT
-   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Role-Based Access Control Specifications:

### Super Admin Role:
- **Dashboard Access**: System-wide dashboard with global metrics and tenant management
- **Permissions**: 
  - Manage all tenants and their configurations
  - Create/edit/delete tenant administrators
  - Access system-wide reports and analytics
  - Configure global system settings
  - View audit logs across all tenants
- **Restrictions**: Cannot directly manage individual students/teachers (delegated to tenant admins)

### Tenant Admin Role:
- **Dashboard Access**: Tenant-specific administrative dashboard
- **Permissions**:
  - Manage users within their tenant (students, teachers, staff)
  - Create/edit/delete user accounts and assign roles
  - Configure tenant-specific settings
  - Access tenant-specific reports and analytics
  - Manage academic structure (courses, subjects)
  - View tenant audit logs
- **Restrictions**: Cannot access other tenants' data or global system settings

### Teacher Role:
- **Dashboard Access**: Teacher-specific dashboard with academic focus
- **Permissions**:
  - View assigned students and classes
  - Access academic management (courses, subjects) - read only
  - Manage gradebooks and assessments
  - View student attendance and performance
  - Access teacher-specific reports
- **Restrictions**: Cannot manage users, create courses/subjects, or access administrative functions

### Student Role:
- **Dashboard Access**: Student-specific dashboard with limited functionality
- **Permissions**:
  - View personal academic records
  - Access assigned courses and subjects
  - View grades and attendance
  - Access student-specific announcements
- **Restrictions**: Cannot manage users, access administrative functions, or view other students' data
