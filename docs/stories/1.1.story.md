# User Story: As a Tenant Admin, I want to create and manage user accounts for students, teachers, and staff within my school, so that I can control access to the system and maintain accurate records.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to create new user accounts with specified roles (Student, Teacher, Staff).
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to edit existing user profiles and assign/reassign roles.
- The system shall ensure that each user account has a unique identifier within the tenant.
- The system shall prevent unauthorized access to tenant-specific data based on assigned roles.

## Dev Notes:

### Previous Story Insights:
No previous story insights available.

### Data Models:
-   **Users Table:** Authentication and authorization details (linked to Students/Teachers/Admins) will be managed in a `Users` table within PostgreSQL. Data will be normalized, relationships established with foreign keys, and appropriate indexing applied.

### API Specifications:
-   **RESTful APIs:** Primary method for external systems and frontend applications to interact with the backend services. All API endpoints will be secured using industry-standard authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT) and authorization (e.g., RBAC) mechanisms.

### Component Specifications:
-   **Frontend:** React components will be developed for user account creation, editing, and role management.
-   **Backend:** Node.js services will handle user account logic, interacting with the PostgreSQL database.

### File Locations:
-   Frontend components will reside in the `frontend/src/components` directory (or similar, based on project structure).
-   Backend API routes and controllers will be in `backend/routes` and `backend/controllers` respectively.
-   Database models/schemas will be defined in `backend/models`.

### Testing Requirements:
-   Unit tests for backend API endpoints (e.g., user creation, update, role assignment).
-   Integration tests to ensure proper interaction between frontend and backend.
-   End-to-end tests for user account management flows.
-   Security tests for authentication and authorization mechanisms.

### Technical Constraints:
-   **Frontend:** React
-   **Backend:** Node.js
-   **Database:** PostgreSQL
-   **Authentication:** OAuth2/JWT
-   **Authorization:** Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

## Tasks / Subtasks:
