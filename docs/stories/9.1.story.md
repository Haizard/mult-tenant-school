# User Story: As a Tenant Admin, I want to manage and publish school-wide content like announcements, events, and documents, to ensure effective communication with students, parents, and staff.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to create, edit, publish, and schedule announcements and news articles.
- The system shall allow for the targeting of content to specific audiences (e.g., all students, a specific class, all parents).
- The system shall include an event calendar where school events can be created and managed.
- The system shall provide a secure repository for uploading, organizing, and sharing documents (e.g., policies, forms, newsletters).
- The system shall grant access to view or download specific documents based on user roles or group assignments.
- The system shall integrate with the notification module to alert users about new or important content.
- All content, including announcements, events, and documents, must be strictly isolated by tenant.

## Examples:
- **Targeted Announcement:** The school principal wants to inform only the parents of 'Grade 10' about an upcoming parent-teacher meeting. They create an announcement, write the message, and set the audience to 'Parents of Grade 10'. Only those specific users will see the announcement on their portal and receive a notification.
- **Document Sharing:** The administration uploads the 'School Health and Safety Policy 2024.pdf' to the document repository. They place it in the 'School Policies' folder and set the permissions so that only 'Staff' and 'Parents' can view and download it.

## Potential Obstacles:
- **Rich Text Editor Implementation:** Integrating a full-featured and secure WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for creating content can be challenging. It needs to produce clean HTML and prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks by sanitizing user input.
- **File Storage and Management:** Managing file uploads, especially large files, can be complex. The system needs a robust solution for storing files (e.g., cloud storage like AWS S3 or a local file system), managing permissions, and handling large uploads without timing out.
- **Calendar Complexity:** While a simple event calendar is straightforward, building an interactive calendar with features like recurring events, RSVPs, and integration with external calendars (e.g., Google Calendar) adds significant complexity.

## Dev Notes:

### Previous Story Insights:
- User & Role Management (Story 1.1) is fundamental for audience targeting and access control for documents.
- The notification system (to be detailed in a Cross-Cutting story) will be triggered by this module.

### Data Models:
- **ContentPosts Table:** To store announcements, news articles, and other post-like content. It would include fields for title, body, author, publication date, and target audience.
- **CalendarEvents Table:** To store information about school events.
- **Documents Table:** To store metadata about uploaded files (e.g., file name, path, size, file type).
- **DocumentPermissions Table:** A join table to link documents to the roles or groups that have permission to access them.

## Tasks / Subtasks:
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2): Implement the back-end and front-end for creating and managing announcements/news, including audience targeting.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 3): Build the event calendar module, allowing for event creation and a calendar view.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 4, 5): Develop the document repository, including file upload functionality and permission management.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 6): Integrate content creation with the notification system to trigger alerts.
- [ ] Task 5 (AC: 7): Ensure strict tenant isolation for all content, events, and documents.
- [ ] Task 6 (Security): Select and implement a secure rich text editor, ensuring all user-generated content is sanitized.
- [ ] Task 7 (Infrastructure): Set up a file storage solution (e.g., a dedicated folder on the server or a cloud bucket) for document uploads.
