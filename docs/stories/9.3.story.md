# User Story: As a School Administrator, I want each school to have its own front-end website with dynamic pages (home, admission, contact, gallery, about us, etc.), so that I can provide a professional online presence for the school with proper data isolation and security.

- **Content Management**: Schools can manage their website content
- **Security**: Prevent data breaching through proper tenant isolation and access control

### **âœ… IMPLEMENTATION GUIDELINES:**
