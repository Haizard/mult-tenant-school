# User Story: As a System Administrator, I want to manage tenants in the system, so that I can onboard new schools and manage their lifecycle, ensuring absolute data separation.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall be built on a multi-tenant architecture where the data for each school (tenant) is strictly isolated.
- The system shall provide an interface for a System Administrator to create, manage, suspend, and reactivate tenant accounts.
- When a new tenant is created, the system shall provision their account and create an initial 'Tenant Admin' user for that school. **This admin, and every subsequent user, must be directly associated with the tenant's `tenant_id` in the `Users` table.**
- **Every table containing tenant-specific data, including `Users`, `Students`, `Grades`, `Finance`, etc., MUST have a non-nullable `tenant_id` column.**
- **Every single database query (read, write, update, delete) executed by the application must be filtered by the `tenant_id` of the currently authenticated user. There are no exceptions.**
- A query for one tenant must never, under any circumstances, return data from another tenant.
- The tenant onboarding process should be automated as much as possible.
- **The system shall provide dedicated tenant management panels for each user role with appropriate functionality and restrictions.**
- **Students and Teachers shall have no access to tenant management or system administration functions.**
- **Tenant Admins shall only manage their own tenant and cannot access other tenants or system-wide configurations.**
- **Super Admins shall have full access to tenant management, system configuration, and cross-tenant operations.**

## Examples:
- **New School Onboarding:** A System Admin creates a new tenant, 'Evergreen Academy'. The system generates a unique `tenant_id` (e.g., `e3b0c442...`). It then inserts a new record into the `Users` table for their admin, and this user record explicitly includes the `tenant_id: 'e3b0c442...'`.
- **Data Isolation Enforcement:** When the admin for 'Evergreen Academy' logs in, a `tenant_id` is stored in their session. Every subsequent API call they make uses a data access layer that **automatically and mandatorily** adds `WHERE tenant_id = 'e3b0c442...'` to all SQL queries.

## Potential Obstacles:
- **Architectural Discipline:** The chosen multi-tenancy model (shared database with a `tenant_id` column) requires **extreme, unwavering discipline** in the data access layer. One mistake can cause a major data breach. The technical design must make it impossible for a developer to forget the tenant filter.
- **Preventing Data Leakage:** A single missing `WHERE tenant_id = ?` clause in a complex query can cause a catastrophic data breach. This requires building a robust and non-bypassable data access layer (e.g., a global query scope or middleware) that automatically applies tenant filtering to every database query. This cannot be an optional or manual step for developers.
- **Cross-Tenant Operations:** Performing operations across all tenants (e.g., for system-wide reporting or data migrations) becomes more complex and needs to be done carefully to avoid performance degradation and to respect data isolation boundaries.

## Dev Notes:

### Previous Story Insights:
- This is a foundational, cross-cutting concern that underpins every other feature in the application. It is not an epic that can be built in isolation but must be integrated into the development of all other features from day one.

### Data Models:
- **Tenants Table:** The central table to store information about each school/tenant, including their unique ID, name, status (active, suspended), and subscription/plan details.
- **`tenant_id` Column:** This column must be added to **every single table** in the database that contains tenant-specific data and be non-nullable. This includes the `Users` table.

## Role-Based Tenant Management Access Control:

### Super Admin:
- **Access Level**: Full system-wide access to all tenant management functions
- **Permissions**: 
  - Create, edit, suspend, and reactivate tenant accounts
  - Manage system-wide configurations and policies
  - Access cross-tenant reports and analytics
  - Monitor system performance and compliance
  - Manage global system settings and features
- **Restrictions**: None - full system access

### Tenant Admin:
- **Access Level**: Read-only access to own tenant information
- **Permissions**:
  - View own tenant configuration and settings
  - Access tenant-specific reports and analytics
  - Manage tenant-specific configurations
- **Restrictions**: Cannot access other tenants, create new tenants, or access system-wide configurations

### Teacher:
- **Access Level**: No access to tenant management
- **Permissions**: None related to tenant management
- **Restrictions**: Cannot access any tenant management or system administration functions

### Student:
- **Access Level**: No access to tenant management
- **Permissions**: None related to tenant management
- **Restrictions**: Cannot access any tenant management or system administration functions

## Tasks / Subtasks:
- [x] Task 1 (Architecture): Formally decide on and document the multi-tenancy architecture strategy (shared DB with mandatory `tenant_id` filtering).
- [x] Task 2 (Dev): Implement the `Tenants` table and the admin interface for managing tenants.
- [x] Task 3 (Dev): Create an automated tenant provisioning process, ensuring the first user is correctly associated with the tenant.
- [x] Task 4 (Dev): **(Critical)** Implement a middleware or extend the ORM's base model/repository to automatically and mandatorily enforce `tenant_id` filtering on all database queries.
- [x] Task 5 (Testing): Create a dedicated suite of integration tests specifically designed to try and break tenant data isolation.
- [x] Task 6 (Dev): Implement the logic and UI for suspending and reactivating a tenant's account.
- [ ] Task 7 (AC: 7): Implement role-based access control for tenant management APIs.
- [ ] Task 8 (AC: 8): Create role-specific tenant management dashboard components.
- [ ] Task 9 (AC: 9): Implement comprehensive tenant data filtering based on user roles.
