# User Story: As a Librarian, I want to manage the school library's collection, circulation, and fines, so that I can provide an efficient library service to students and staff.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow a Librarian to catalog and manage the library's collection of books and other resources, including details like title, author, ISBN, and genre.
- The system shall support the full circulation process: issuing books to users (students/teachers), recording returns, and handling renewals.
- The system shall allow the Librarian to define and enforce borrowing rules, such as borrowing periods, limits per user, and renewal policies.
- The system shall automatically track due dates and identify overdue books.
- The system shall allow a Librarian to manage library patrons (borrowers), view their borrowing history, and see currently issued books.
- The system shall have a feature to calculate and apply fines for overdue, damaged, or lost books based on configurable rules.
- The system shall provide a search interface for users to find books in the catalog.
- All library data, including the catalog, circulation records, and fines, must be strictly isolated by tenant.

## Examples:
- **Book Checkout Process:** A student brings a book to the library counter. The Librarian scans the student's ID card (or searches for their name) and then scans the book's ISBN. The system confirms the checkout, records the due date based on the school's policy (e.g., 14 days), and decrements the book's available count.
- **Overdue Fine Calculation:** A book was due on Monday. A student returns it on Wednesday. The school has a policy of $0.50 per day fine. The system automatically calculates a $1.00 fine and adds it to the student's library account.

## Potential Obstacles:
- **Integration with Barcode/RFID Scanners:** While not in the initial scope, designing the system to easily integrate with hardware like barcode scanners for quick circulation is a key consideration for future-proofing. This involves handling hardware input correctly in a web-based interface.
- **Inventory Management:** A full-fledged library system often includes complex inventory management (stock-taking) features. While the initial story focuses on circulation, the data model should be robust enough to support future inventory features without major rework.
- **User Experience for Search:** Providing a powerful and intuitive search experience (e.g., searching by title, author, keyword, or genre with effective filtering and sorting) is crucial for a good user experience but can be complex to implement efficiently, especially with a large catalog.

## Dev Notes:

### Previous Story Insights:
- User & Role Management (Story 1.1) is needed to define the 'Librarian' role and to identify patrons (students and teachers).
- Student & Teacher Management (Story 5.1) provides the core user data for library patrons.

### Data Models:
- **LibraryBooks Table:** To store the catalog of all books, including ISBN, title, author, genre, quantity, and availability status.
- **LibraryBorrowingRules Table:** To store tenant-specific rules (e.g., borrowing duration, max books per user).
- **LibraryCirculation Table:** A transaction log to record all book checkouts, returns, and renewals, linking a book to a user with dates.
- **LibraryFines Table:** To record fines owed by users for overdue or lost books.

## Tasks / Subtasks:
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 7): Implement CRUD operations for the book catalog and the user-facing search interface.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 2): Develop the circulation workflow for issuing, returning, and renewing books.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 3, 6): Implement the functionality for Librarians to configure borrowing rules and fine policies.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 4): Create a system job or query to automatically identify and flag overdue books.
- [ ] Task 5 (AC: 5): Implement the patron management view, showing user borrowing history and current checkouts.
- [ ] Task 6 (AC: 8): Ensure strict tenant isolation (`tenant_id`) across all library-related database tables and APIs.
- [ ] Task 7 (Future): Research and design the data structures needed for future barcode/RFID integration.
