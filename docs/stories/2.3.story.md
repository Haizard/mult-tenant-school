# User Story: As a Teacher, I want to manage a gradebook for my classes, so that I can track student performance effectively. As a Tenant Admin, I want to configure the grading system for my school.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to define and customize grading scales (e.g., letter grades, percentages, points) for the school.
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to define weighted categories for assessments (e.g., homework 20%, quizzes 30%, exams 50%).
- The system shall allow a Teacher to create assignments and exams within the gradebook.
- The system shall allow a Teacher to enter grades for assignments and exams for each student.
- The system shall automatically calculate the overall grade for each student based on the configured weights and scales.
- The system shall allow students and parents to view their grades and progress.
- The system shall ensure that all gradebook and grading system data is isolated by tenant.

## Examples:
- **Weighted Category Example:** A Tenant Admin sets up a grading system where for the "Math" course, "Homework" is weighted at 20%, "Quizzes" at 30%, and the "Final Exam" at 50%. A student with scores of 90 in Homework, 80 in Quizzes, and 70 in the Final Exam would have a calculated overall grade of (0.20 * 90) + (0.30 * 80) + (0.50 * 70) = 18 + 24 + 35 = 77.
- **Grade Scale Example:** The Tenant Admin defines 'A' as 90-100, 'B' as 80-89, etc. A student with a calculated score of 77 would receive a 'C' grade.

## Potential Obstacles:
- **Complex Calculation Logic:** The grade calculation engine needs to be robust and flexible enough to handle various weighting schemes and custom formulas that different schools might use. This includes handling missing grades, extra credit, and different scales for different subjects.
- **Real-time Grade Updates:** Ensuring that grade calculations are updated in real-time as teachers enter scores, and that these updates are immediately reflected to students and parents, can be challenging from a performance perspective, especially with large classes.
- **Data Integrity and Security:** Grade data is highly sensitive. Ensuring data integrity (e.g., preventing accidental or malicious changes) and providing a secure audit trail for all grade modifications is critical.

## Dev Notes:

### Previous Story Insights:
- User & Role Management (Story 1.1) is crucial for ensuring that only authorized teachers can enter grades and only the correct students/parents can view them.
- Course & Subject Management (Story 2.1) provides the context for which gradebooks are created.

### Data Models:
- **GradingScales Table:** To store tenant-defined grading scales.
- **GradebookCategories Table:** To store weighted categories for assessments (e.g., Homework, Quizzes, Exams) per course.
- **Assignments Table:** To store details of assignments and exams.
- **Grades Table:** To store student grades for each assignment.
- **CalculatedGrades Table:** To store the calculated overall grades for each student in each course.

## Tasks / Subtasks:
- [ ] Task 1 (AC: 1, 2): Implement the interface for Tenant Admins to configure grading scales and weighted categories.
- [ ] Task 2 (AC: 3, 4): Implement the interface for Teachers to create assignments and enter grades.
- [ ] Task 3 (AC: 5): Develop the grade calculation engine to handle weighted averages and scale conversions.
- [ ] Task 4 (AC: 6): Create read-only views for students and parents to see their grades.
- [ ] Task 5 (AC: 7): Ensure strict tenant isolation for all grading data.
- [ ] Task 6 (Security): Implement audit trails for all grade entries and modifications.
