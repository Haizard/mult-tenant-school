# User Story: As a Tenant Admin, I want to manage comprehensive profiles for students and teachers, so that I can maintain accurate and centralized records for my school.

## Acceptance Criteria:
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to create, view, update, and delete detailed student profiles, including personal information, guardian details, academic history, and health records.
- The system shall provide a streamlined workflow for student enrollment, registration, and assignment to specific classes and sections.
- The system shall support bulk import and export of student and teacher data using CSV files to facilitate easy data migration and management.
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to manage student statuses (e.g., active, inactive, withdrawn, graduated).
- The system shall allow a Tenant Admin to create, view, update, and delete detailed teacher profiles, including personal information, qualifications, experience, and subjects taught.
- The system shall support the assignment of teachers to specific classes and subjects, integrating with the scheduling module.
- The system shall generate reports on student demographics, enrollment trends, and teacher workloads.
- All student and teacher data, profiles, and assignments must be strictly isolated by tenant.
- **The system shall provide dedicated student and teacher management panels for each user role with appropriate functionality and restrictions.**
- **Students shall only view and edit their own profile information and cannot access other students' or teachers' data.**
- **Teachers shall view their own profile and assigned students' basic information, but cannot manage user accounts or access administrative functions.**
- **Tenant Admins shall have full access to student and teacher management, including profile creation, editing, and bulk operations.**
- **Super Admins shall have system-wide view access to student and teacher data across all tenants for monitoring purposes.**

## Examples:
- **Bulk Student Import:** A school administrator downloads the provided CSV template for students, fills it with the details of 50 new admissions (including name, DOB, guardian contact), and uploads the file. The system validates the data (e.g., checking for valid date formats, required fields) and creates the 50 new student profiles, reporting any rows that had errors.
- **Comprehensive Profile View:** When viewing a student's profile, the information is organized into tabs: a "Summary" tab with key details, a "Guardians" tab with parent contact info, an "Academic" tab showing enrolled courses and grades, and an "Attendance" tab with their attendance history.

## Potential Obstacles:
- **Data Migration Complexity:** Existing schools will have their data in various unstructured formats. Building a robust data importer that can handle data validation, mapping legacy fields to the new system, and providing clear error feedback for failed imports is a significant challenge.
- **User Interface Design:** Student and teacher profiles can contain a vast amount of information. Designing a user interface that is comprehensive but not overwhelming is critical. It will require careful use of tabs, collapsible sections, and clear navigation to avoid cluttering the screen.
- **Inter-Module Data Consistency:** This module is the central hub for person-specific data and is tightly coupled with Academics, Attendance, Finance, and User Management. Ensuring data consistency (e.g., when a student is withdrawn, they should be unenrolled from classes and their parent's portal access disabled) requires careful planning of data relationships and potential use of transactional operations.

## Dev Notes:

### Previous Story Insights:
- User & Role Management (Story 1.1) is a prerequisite, as both Students and Teachers are users with specific roles.
- This module will provide the core data for many other features, including scheduling, grading, and attendance.

### Data Models:
- **Students Table:** To store student personal information, enrollment details, and status. Will have a foreign key to the `Users` table.
- **Guardians Table:** To store parent/guardian information, linked to one or more students.
- **StudentHealthRecords Table:** A separate table for sensitive health information to allow for stricter access control.
- **Teachers Table:** To store teacher personal information, qualifications, and status. Will have a foreign key to the `Users` table.
- **TeacherAssignments Table:** A join table to link teachers to the specific classes and subjects they teach for a given academic year.

## Role-Based Student & Teacher Management Access Control:

### Super Admin:

- **Restrictions**: Cannot access other tenants' student/teacher data

### Teacher:
- **Access Level**: View own profile, view assigned students' basic information
- **Permissions**:
  - View and edit own profile information
  - View basic information for assigned students
  - Access teacher-specific reports
- **Restrictions**: Cannot create/edit student profiles, view other teachers' students, or access administrative functions

### Student:
- **Access Level**: Read-only access to own profile information
