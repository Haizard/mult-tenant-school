## ‚úÖ DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION

### 1. Service Status Check

**Check if service is running:**
```bash
curl -I https://school-management-api.onrender.com/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```
HTTP/2 200
Content-Type: application/json
```

**Full Response:**
```bash
curl https://school-management-api.onrender.com/health
```

**Expected Output:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-16T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è DATABASE VERIFICATION

### 1. Check Database Connection

**Verify Prisma can connect:**
```bash
# This happens during build, but you can verify in logs
# Look for: "Prisma schema loaded"
# Look for: "Migrations applied successfully"
```

### 2. Verify Tables Exist

**Check in Supabase:**
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard
2. Select "school_system" project
3. Go to **SQL Editor**
4. Run:
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name;
```

**Should include:**
- activities
- student_activities
- health_records
- students
- parents
- teachers
- classes
- users
- roles
- permissions
