## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

### 1. **INCOMPLETE PARENT PORTAL ENDPOINTS** üî¥
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** `backend/src/controllers/parentController.js` (lines 633-650)

**Issue:** Four critical parent portal endpoints return 501 (Not Implemented):
- `getChildGrades` - Parents cannot view child's grades
- `getChildSchedule` - Parents cannot view child's schedule
- `updateParentRelation` - Cannot update parent-student relationships
- `deleteParentRelation` - Cannot delete parent-student relationships

**Impact:** Parents have incomplete access to their children's information

**Fix Required:**
```javascript
// Implement getChildGrades
const getChildGrades = async (req, res) => {
  const { id, studentId } = req.params;
  // Verify relationship, then fetch grades
  const grades = await prisma.grade.findMany({
    where: { studentId, tenantId: req.tenantId },
    include: { examination: true, subject: true }
  });
};

// Implement getChildSchedule
const getChildSchedule = async (req, res) => {
  const { id, studentId } = req.params;
  // Verify relationship, then fetch schedule
  const schedule = await prisma.schedule.findMany({
    where: { classId: student.class?.id, tenantId: req.tenantId }
  });
};
```

### 2. **MISSING SCHOOL ACTIVITIES/EXTRACURRICULAR MODULE** üî¥
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Location:** Database schema & Backend

**Issue:** No model for school activities or extracurricular programs found in schema

**Missing Models:**
- Activity/Club model
- StudentActivity enrollment
- Activity schedule and attendance
- Activity leaders/coordinators

**Impact:** Cannot track student participation in extracurricular activities

**Required Schema Addition:**
```prisma
model Activity {
  id String @id @default(cuid())
  tenantId String
  name String
  description String?
  type String // SPORTS, CLUB, CULTURAL, ACADEMIC, etc.
  leader String? // Teacher ID
  maxCapacity Int?
  schedule String? // Days/times
  status ActivityStatus @default(ACTIVE)
  students StudentActivity[]
  tenant Tenant @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id])
}

model StudentActivity {
  id String @id @default(cuid())
  tenantId String
  studentId String
  activityId String
  joinDate DateTime
  status ActivityEnrollmentStatus
  student Student @relation(fields: [studentId], references: [id])
  activity Activity @relation(fields: [activityId], references: [id])
  tenant Tenant @relation(fields: [tenantId], references: [id])
}
```

### 3. **INCOMPLETE TEACHER DATA INTEGRATION** üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** Teacher model and routes

**Issue:** Teacher data not fully integrated with all modules:
- ‚ùå No direct link to student academic records for grading
- ‚ùå Teacher-Student relationship not explicitly modeled
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Teacher access to student grades needs verification

**Current State:**
- Teachers can create grades (via examinationController)
- Teachers can mark attendance
- Teachers assigned to classes (TeacherClass)
- Teachers assigned to subjects (TeacherSubject)

**Missing:** Explicit authorization checks ensuring teachers only access their assigned students' data

### 4. **LIBRARIAN ROLE INCOMPLETE** üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** Library system

**Issue:** Librarian role created but incomplete implementation:
- ‚úÖ Librarian can manage books
- ‚úÖ Librarian can issue/return books
- ‚ùå No librarian-specific dashboard/UI
- ‚ùå No librarian access to student borrowing history
- ‚ùå No fine management interface for librarians

**Missing Endpoints:**
- GET `/library/users/:userId/borrowing-history`
- GET `/library/fines/unpaid`
- PUT `/library/fines/:fineId/waive`

### 5. **PARENT DATA PRIVACY CONCERNS** üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** Parent portal routes

**Issue:** Parent access control implemented but needs verification:
- ‚úÖ Relationship verification in place
- ‚úÖ TenantId filtering applied
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No explicit check that parent can only access their own children
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No audit logging for parent data access

**Recommendation:** Add explicit parent ID verification:
```javascript
// Verify parent is accessing their own data
const parent = await prisma.parent.findFirst({
  where: { id: parentId, userId: req.user.id, tenantId: req.tenantId }
});
if (!parent) return res.status(403).json({ message: 'Access denied' });
```

### 6. **MISSING STUDENT HEALTH RECORDS INTEGRATION** üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** Database & Controllers

**Issue:** HealthRecord model exists but:
- ‚ùå No API endpoints for health records
- ‚ùå No parent access to health records
- ‚ùå No teacher access to medical information
- ‚ùå No health record management interface

**Required Endpoints:**
- GET `/students/:id/health-records`
- POST `/students/:id/health-records`
- GET `/parents/:id/children/:studentId/health-records`

### 7. **MISSING STUDENT DOCUMENTS MANAGEMENT** üü°
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** StudentDocument model exists but unused

**Issue:** StudentDocument model in schema but:
- ‚ùå No API endpoints
- ‚ùå No document upload/download functionality
- ‚ùå No document verification workflow
