# üöÄ NEXT STEPS - Website Management Feature Integration

## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete - Ready for Integration

The Website Management feature has been fully implemented and is ready for integration into your dashboard.

---

## üìã Immediate Next Steps (Required)

### Step 1: Create the Website Dashboard Route
**File**: `app/(dashboard)/website/page.tsx`

```typescript
'use client';

import WebsiteDashboard from '@/app/components/website/WebsiteDashboard';

export default function WebsitePage() {
  return <WebsiteDashboard />;
}
```

**Why**: This creates the route that users will visit to access the website management dashboard.

---

### Step 2: Add Navigation Link
**File**: Update your dashboard navigation component

Find your navigation/sidebar component and add:

```typescript
import { GlobeIcon } from '@heroicons/react/24/outline'; // or your icon library

// In your navigation menu:
<NavLink 
  href="/dashboard/website" 
  icon={<GlobeIcon className="w-5 h-5" />}
>
  Website Management
</NavLink>
```

**Why**: This allows users to access the website management feature from the dashboard.

---

### Step 3: Verify Database Setup
**Command**:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma db push
```

**Expected Output**:
```
‚úì Database synced, no migrations were run
```

**Why**: Ensures all website tables are created in the database.

---

### Step 4: Test the Integration
**Steps**:
1. Start your backend server: `npm run dev` (in backend directory)
2. Start your frontend: `npm run dev` (in app directory)
3. Navigate to `/dashboard/website`
4. You should see the Website Management Dashboard

**Expected Result**: Dashboard loads with "Pages", "Settings", and "Analytics" tabs.

## üîç Verification Checklist

### Database
- [ ] Run `npx prisma db push` successfully
- [ ] All 5 tables created (website_pages, website_content, website_gallery, website_settings, website_analytics)
- [ ] Verify in database client (e.g., Prisma Studio: `npx prisma studio`)

### Backend
- [ ] Routes registered in `backend/src/server.js`
- [ ] Controllers created in `backend/src/controllers/websiteController.js`
- [ ] Routes created in `backend/src/routes/websiteRoutes.js`
- [ ] Test script runs without errors

### Frontend
- [ ] Route file created: `app/(dashboard)/website/page.tsx`
- [ ] Navigation link added
- [ ] Components load without errors
- [ ] Dashboard displays correctly

### Security
- [ ] Authentication middleware applied to all routes
- [ ] Tenant isolation verified (queries include tenantId)
- [ ] Audit logging working (check logs)
- [ ] Error messages don't leak sensitive info

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Page not found" when visiting `/dashboard/website`
**Solution**: 
1. Verify route file exists: `app/(dashboard)/website/page.tsx`
2. Check file content matches the template above
3. Restart the frontend server

### Issue: "Cannot find module" errors
**Solution**:
1. Verify all component files exist in `app/components/website/`
2. Verify service file exists: `lib/websiteService.ts`
3. Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are installed

### Issue: Database errors
**Solution**:
1. Run `npx prisma db push` to sync schema
2. Check `backend/.env` has correct DATABASE_URL
3. Verify database file exists or is accessible

### Issue: Authentication errors
**Solution**:
1. Verify JWT token is valid
2. Check `authenticate` middleware is applied to routes
3. Verify user object contains `tenantId`

### Issue: Tenant isolation not working
**Solution**:
1. Verify all queries include `tenantId` filter
2. Check user context is extracted from JWT
3. Verify `req.user.tenantId` is set correctly

## üìä Performance Optimization (Optional)

### Add Pagination
Update `getWebsitePages` to support pagination:
```typescript
const { page = 1, limit = 10 } = req.query;
const skip = (page - 1) * limit;

const pages = await prisma.websitePage.findMany({
  where,
  skip,
  take: limit,
  orderBy: { createdAt: 'desc' },
});
```

### Add Caching
Consider caching website settings:
```typescript
// Cache settings for 5 minutes
const cacheKey = `website-settings-${tenantId}`;
const cached = await redis.get(cacheKey);
if (cached) return cached;
```

### Add Indexing
Add database indexes for frequently queried fields:
```prisma
model WebsitePage {
  @@index([tenantId])
  @@index([pageSlug])
  @@index([status])
}
```
