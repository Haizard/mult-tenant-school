- [ ] Activity capacity is tracked
- [ ] Students can be removed from activities
- [ ] Activity list filters work correctly

### Health Records
- [ ] Records created with correct date

## üêõ TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Activity not found"
**Solution:** Verify activity ID and tenant ID match

### Issue: "Access denied: No relationship with this student"
**Solution:** Verify parent-student relationship exists in database

### Issue: "Student not found"
**Solution:** Verify student ID and tenant ID match

### Issue: Migration fails
**Solution:** 
```bash
# Reset database (development only)
npx prisma migrate reset

# Or manually check schema
npx prisma db push
```

---

## üìä PERFORMANCE TESTING

### Load Test Activities Endpoint
```bash
# Using Apache Bench
ab -n 1000 -c 10 -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  http://localhost:5000/api/activities

# Expected: <200ms response time
```

### Database Query Performance
```bash
# Check slow queries in logs
tail -f logs/database.log | grep "duration"
```

---

## üéØ FINAL VERIFICATION

After all tests pass:

1. ‚úÖ Run full test suite
2. ‚úÖ Check code coverage
3. ‚úÖ Verify no console errors
4. ‚úÖ Check database integrity
5. ‚úÖ Verify multi-tenant isolation
6. ‚úÖ Test with multiple users
7. ‚úÖ Verify authorization on all endpoints
